ExtraWatch 1.2.18 license, Terms & Conditions of usage

Please read carefully:
General
This component is licensed under the GNU GPL license and comes with absolutely
NO WARRANTY and NO SUPPORT. You read this license and agree to terms and
conditions of this license.

    * You also agree that author is not responsible for any possible problems
    and consequences of using this software
    * You also agree to use it on your own responsibility, respecting all the
    laws applicable for your country and countries of your visitors
    * You also agree to respect the privacy of your visitors by placing a
    notice into your Privacy policy page, that your site uses this software.
    * You also agree that you can be informed via an email you provided during
     registration about the information about this software. This makes it
     easier when there is a need to inform you about the latest versions
     and/or possible security updates.

Security
            This software has been thoroughly and manually tested for several
            vulnerabilities. Further details are in security_certificate.pdf
            included in the downloaded package.

License key
            License key is issued per domain. After the purchase via paypal,
            user is redirected to codegravity.com, where he fills his domain
            name.
            The system generated the key based on this domain name and sends
            it via email. The key works for all sub-domains as well.
            If user made the purchase and received no license key, it is
            because he interrupted the process and was not returned back to
            codegravity.com.
            In this case, the use can request the correct license key from
            initial license activation screen. User agree not to abuse this
            mechanism.
            Transfer of license to other domain is permitted in special
            cases.
            User must prove that the age of domain to transfer the license
            to is newer than the original one the license key was issued for.

Updates
            License owner has right for free lifetime updates of this software.
            There is an automatic update mechanism available, but in case of
            huge differences and incompatibilities between two versions,
            user has to install this software without any support from
            supplier's side.

Refund policy
            User can ask for refund of his purchase for any reason within the
            30-day period, using paypal's dispute mechanism.
            Refund may not be immediate, but we are doing them as quicky as
            possible.
            After the refund is made, user must uninstall the extension and
            is not allowed to use it, except cases when supplier permitted it.
            If user still continues to use this extension, supplier can send
            an invoice to pay for the license.

Support
            Users can submit the support tickets via the ticketing system on
            codegravity.com providing the paypal transaction id.
            Questions sent directly via email can be overlooked, that's why it
            is strongly recommended to use the ticketing system for all
            communication.
            We care about our users, but we reserve a right not to solve
            every ticket,
            especially those which are not related to software defects or
            licensing.
            User must first check for latest version of the software - usually
            the new update contains the needed fixes.
            Solving the issue can be a long process and because sometimes the
            issue cannot be reproduced locally, user might be asked to create
            the temporary
            administration access for developers to be able to reproduce the
            problem.
            User is not obligated to create this access.
            If permitted, user verified that he or his web hosting provider has
            the very latest backup of the database and affected remote root
            directory.
            Developers inform user about every change. Some changes may result
            in a temporary downtime of website until the issue is fixed.

Reviews
            We never ask users to submit positive review in Joomla Extensions
            Directory in return for some value. Users can freely share their
            opinion on this software,
            but submitting a review which is against these terms and conditions
            user agreed to, can be treated as defamation with possible
            consequences.
