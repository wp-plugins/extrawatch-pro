            This software has been thoroughly and manually tested for several vulnerabilities. Further details are in security_certificate.pdf included in the downloaded package.

            License owner has right for free lifetime updates of this software.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            There is an automatic update mechanism available, but in case of huge differences and incompatibilities between two versions,  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            user has to install this software without any support from supplier's side.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  

            <h2>Refund policy</h2>  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            User can ask for refund of his purchase for any reason within the 30-day period, using paypal's dispute mechanism.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            Refund may not be immediate, but we are doing them as quicky as possible.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            After the refund is made, user must uninstall the extension and is not allowed to use it, except cases when supplier permitted it.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            If user still continues to use this extension, supplier can send an invoice to pay for the license.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  

            <h2>Support</h2>  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            Users can submit the support tickets via the ticketing system on codegravity.com providing the paypal transaction id.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            Questions sent directly via email can be overlooked, that's why it is strongly recommended to use the ticketing system for all communication.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            We care about our users, but we reserve a right not to solve every ticket,  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            especially those which are not related to software defects or licensing.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            User must first check for latest version of the software - usually the new update contains the needed fixes.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            Solving the issue can be a long process and because sometimes the issue cannot be reproduced locally, user might be asked to create the temporary  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            administration access for developers to be able to reproduce the problem.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            User is not obligated to create this access.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            If permitted, user verified that he or his web hosting provider has the very latest backup of the database and affected remote root directory.  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            Developers inform user about every change. Some changes may result in a temporary downtime of website until the issue is fixed.

            We never ask users to submit positive review in Joomla Extensions Directory in return for some value. Users can freely share their opinion on this software,  	 	    	    		  	 	  	 	  		 	 		    	 			 	   		  	 	 		 	 	   	      	  	 		 		 				 			 		  		    	 		 		  
            but submitting a review which is against these terms and conditions user agreed to, can be treated as defamation with possible consequences.
